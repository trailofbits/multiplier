# Multiplier: Find more bugs faster

Multiplier provides precise, and comprehensive code understanding capabilities
by storing a compressed representation of build artifacts, called entities, in
an index database. Entities in Multiplierâ€™s index include files, tokens, macro
expansions, abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes, and compilations (represented with
MLIR). Each entity is uniquely identified by a 64 bit integer, and is available
through scripting in C++ or Python as a fully formed object with methods. For
example, the AST entities (declarations, statements, types, templates, etc.) are
persistent forms of AST nodes found in Clang, and the methods available on these
entities mirror those that can be called on those objects in-memory in Clang.
With Multiplier's API, you can get everywhere from anywhere.
