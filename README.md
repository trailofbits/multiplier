# Multiplier: Find more bugs faster

Multiplier provides precise, and comprehensive code understanding capabilities
by storing a compressed representation of build artifacts, called entities, in
an index database. Entities in Multiplierâ€™s index include files, tokens, macro
expansions, abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes, and compilations (represented with
MLIR). Each entity is uniquely identified by a 64 bit integer, and is available
through scripting in C++ or Python as a fully formed object with methods. For
example, the AST entities (declarations, statements, types, templates, etc.) are
persistent forms of AST nodes found in Clang, and the methods available on these
entities mirror those that can be called on those objects in-memory in Clang.
With Multiplier's API, you can get everywhere from anywhere.

  - [mx-find-linked-structures](): Find data structures containing self-referential pointers (e.g. linked lists, trees), or that transitively contain such self-referential data structures
  - [mx-find-sketchy-casts](): Generic "sketchy" cast finder (e.g. implicit downcasts)
  - [mx-harness](): Extract an entity (e.g. function) and all of its dependencies, and save them into a file
  - [mx-highlight-entity](): Highlight a specific entity within its surrounding code
  - [mx-print-call-graph](): Print a call graph (DOT digraph format)
  - [mx-print-reference-graph](): Print the reference graph (DOT digraph format)
  - [mx-print-token-graph](): Print the graph (DOT digraph format) relating source code, macros, parsed tokens, and AST nodes for a given fragment
  - [mx-taint-entity](): Print the taint graph (DOT digraph format) given a taint source, and treating memory dereferences as taint sinks
