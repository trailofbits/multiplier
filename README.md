# _Multiplier_ finds more bugs faster

Multiplier provides precise and comprehensive code understanding capabilities.
It does so by saving build artifacts into a database, and then making them
persistently accessible using a C++ or Python API.

Multiplier emphasizes the ability to uniquely identify *all* entities in a build
process, including individual tokens, AST nodes, and intermediate
representations. With Multiplier, an analyst can identify code patterns of
interest over one of the representations, and then accurately relay results back
to humans in a readable form, or to follow-on scripts via entity IDs.

Multiplier's APIs are extensive, and often provide as-good or better-than
compiler-level quality information, but linked at a whole-program granularity.
We like to say that with its APIs, *you can get everywhere from anywhere*.
